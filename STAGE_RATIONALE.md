# Stage Selection Rationale

I chose to complete **all four stages (1, 2, 3, and 4)** of this challenge to demonstrate comprehensive AWS data engineering expertise across the full spectrum of cloud technologies.

**Stages 1 & 2 (SQL + Python)** showcase fundamental data engineering skills - the ability to query and transform data using industry-standard tools. These stages prove my proficiency with SQL for data extraction and Python for automated processing, which are essential for any data engineering role.

**Stage 3 (Lambda)** demonstrates my understanding of modern serverless architectures and event-driven design patterns. By implementing automatic query execution on S3 uploads, I showed how to build scalable, cost-effective solutions that respond to real-time data changes.

**Stage 4 (Step Functions)** elevates the solution to enterprise-grade by adding complete workflow orchestration with proper error handling, retry logic, and branching paths. This stage proves I can design resilient, production-ready systems that handle failures gracefully and maintain operational excellence.

By completing all four stages, I've demonstrated not just technical proficiency, but also the ability to architect end-to-end solutions that combine multiple AWS services into cohesive, maintainable systems. This comprehensive approach mirrors real-world data engineering scenarios where multiple technologies must work together seamlessly.
